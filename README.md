# VirtualDub

Unfortunately development of Virutal dub seems to have ceased at v1.10.4
With no repository unavailable to the public, I could not preserve its history.
I've copied the source from the archive on sourceforge to this repository both for my own use and to preserve it in an alternate location to the sourceforge project page.
